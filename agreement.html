							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">3. Your Responsibilities and Registration Obligations</b>
							<br/>
							To use this website, you must first register with us and agree to provide accurate information when requested. When you register, you explicitly agree to our Terms of Service, as they may be modified from time to time and are available here. Accounts cannot be exchanged or sold.

							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">4. Registration and Password</b>

							You are responsible for keeping your password secure and for all uses made possible through your registration and/or login, whether authorized or unauthorized by you. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your registration, user account, or password.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">5. Cheating</b>
							<br/>
							Cheating is defined as any attempt to gain an advantage over other players that does not adhere to the spirit of the game. Cheating will result in a ban for any player who is caught. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to deny anyone access to the services on this website. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">6. Donations</b>
							<br/>
							Any donation made through and only through ZettaChase is entirely voluntary on the part of its users or players, and as a form of compensation, they are given in-game goodies in return. All funds donated to ZettaChase by its users or players are used solely to keep its server and service operational. The owner of ZettaChase will not and should not profit from it. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">Refunds</b>
							<br/>
							Under any circumstances, ZettaChase will not provide a refund. Membership in the ZettaChase is entirely voluntary, and if a user does not wish to be a member, he should not apply for admission. You will not be refunded if you are banned for violating our player rules. You will not be refunded if you are dissatisfied with the service. It is not necessary for you to make a purchase in order to enjoy the full experience of ZettaChase; it is entirely optional and done at your own risk. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">Rewards</b>
							<br/>
							When you make a donation, it is assumed that you are doing so voluntarily. In exchange for donating and assisting us, you will be compensated in-game. You are not purchasing any service; rather, you are assisting in keeping our servers and services operational.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">Charge Backs</b>
							<br/>
							Any attempt to reverse a purchase payment will result in an automatic and immediate IP address ban. All accounts associated with this IP address will be banned indefinitely. Our accounting team always contests all chargebacks and has a high success rate. If this fails, charge backs are routinely forwarded to a third-party collections agency, and the buyer's credit history will be impacted if the charge is not paid for. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">7. Indemnification</b>
							<br/>

							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">11. Advertising</b>
							<br/>
							ZettaChase does not allow its members to post links for which they are eligible for compensation. It is strictly forbidden to advertise other servers directly. Discussion of servers is acceptable as long as the goal is not to persuade members to join other servers. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">12. Etiquette</b>
							<br/>
							Any verbal attacks, whether direct or indirect, on a user, comments that are lewd and/or inappropriate, or comments made simply to annoy another user(s), will not be tolerated. The ZettaChase server staff team is constantly striving to improve and shape the server's vision. Ignoring a server staff member's decision, arguing with a server staff member, or acting in a way that intentionally trolls and/or disrespects the server staff will result in automatic server suspension.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b style="font-size:xx-large;">Updated as of 8/19/2021</b>
							<br/>
							Your rights as a ZettaChase member shield you from public discussion of actions taken against you. All policy violations will be discussed with you in-game via private message. Do not make a complaint/appeal against a server staff member's actions public. If you have a complaint about a member of the server staff or would like to discuss your suspension, please contact administrators privately either here or in-game. The above policies are subject to interpretation by the head administrator and the server staff. We reserve the right to change the above policies at any time if we believe it is necessary for the server's continued operation.
